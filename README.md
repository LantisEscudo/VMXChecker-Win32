VMXChecker-Win32
================

VMX verification and repair application for Windows

This is a simple wrapper GUI around MediaInfo for verifying that a video file
is the correct format for sharing on the Vermont Media Exchange system for
public access stations, and ffmpeg for reencoding files that are not compliant.

For reference, the VMX system requirements:
*Video:
** MPEG-2
** Main@Main profile
** 4:3 DAR
** Interlaced video (field order doesn't matter)
** 720x480

* Audio:
** MPEG-1, Layer 2
** 48000 Hz sampling rate
